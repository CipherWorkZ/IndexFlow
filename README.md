# Warehouse Indexing Demo

A lightweight **Warehouse Management & Indexing System** built as a demo to showcase how pallets, boxes, folders, and documents can be tracked across their entire lifecycle. This project is designed for presentations to non-technical stakeholders, focusing on **workflow clarity**, **business value**, and a clear **path to production**.

## üéØ Purpose

Our organization receives and manages shipments containing sensitive materials (NDA-protected, ISO-certified). Each shipment can contain pallets, each pallet contains boxes, and each box may contain multiple folders or documents. Tracking these items with clarity and accountability is critical for compliance, efficiency, and trust.

The goal of this demo is to **present a simple but powerful indexing system** that:
- Keeps track of shipments from arrival to departure
- Assigns unique, scannable IDs (QR codes) to every pallet, box, and folder
- Provides an easy-to-use interface for warehouse staff and managers
- Ensures sensitive material is handled securely with proper logging

## üì¶ Workflow Overview

1. **Incoming Shipment**  
   - Pallets are received and registered in the system.  
   - Each pallet is assigned a unique ID and linked to the shipment.  

2. **Putaway (Warehousing)**  
   - Pallets are placed on shelves or storage slots.  
   - The system records the exact physical location.  

3. **Breakdown**  
   - Each pallet contains multiple boxes, and each box may contain folders/papers.  
   - IDs are assigned at each level, allowing deep indexing if needed.  

4. **Tracking & Status**  
   - Every pallet has a status: Arriving ‚Üí Warehoused ‚Üí Unpacked ‚Üí Repacked ‚Üí Outgoing.  
   - The status updates as the pallet moves through its lifecycle.  

5. **Outgoing Shipment**  
   - When items leave the warehouse, the system records who checked them out and when.  
   - Audit logs ensure full accountability.

## üñºÔ∏è What‚Äôs in the Demo

- **Warehouse Hierarchy**: Warehouse ‚Üí Shelf ‚Üí Pallet ‚Üí Box ‚Üí Folder.  
- **Unique IDs & QR Codes**: Every item has a scannable ID for fast lookup.  
- **Shipment Tracking**: Register, reconcile, and monitor incoming & outgoing shipments.  
- **Status Updates**: Clearly visible lifecycle stages for each pallet.  
- **Audit Logging**: Who did what, when, and to which item.  

This demo showcases how the system can **simplify warehouse operations** while **ensuring compliance and traceability**.

## üåê Future Plan

1. **User Access Control**  
   - Integration with corporate accounts (Active Directory/Single Sign-On).  
   - Role-based permissions (warehouse staff, managers, auditors).  

2. **Floor Operations**  
   - Handheld scanners or mobile devices to scan pallets/boxes on the warehouse floor.  
   - QR code printing for in-house labeling.  

3. **Reporting & Analytics**  
   - Dashboards for shipment volume, pallet flow, and compliance statistics.  
   - Exportable reports for audits.  

4. **Multi-Warehouse Support**  
   - Support for multiple sites, each with its own storage hierarchy.  
   - Central dashboard to manage and compare across locations.  

5. **Document Integration**  
   - Optional scanning and digital storage of individual folders/papers.  
   - Link physical and digital records for easy retrieval.

## üöÄ Presentation Highlights

- **Problem**: Tracking sensitive shipments manually is slow, error-prone, and risky.  
- **Solution**: A modern indexing system for pallets, boxes, and documents with full lifecycle tracking.  
- **Benefits**: Faster retrieval, fewer mistakes, stronger compliance, and better visibility.  
- **Demo**: A live walk-through of how a shipment is received, stored, tracked, and shipped out.  
- **Future**: Scanners, printers, and enterprise integration to scale the system.
